<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Algorithmically Weighted Ensemble Forecasting
hypothesis: >-
  Time series predictions improve when base forecasting models are dynamically weighted based on their algorithmic complexity
  (measure of simplicity) relative to recent prediction accuracy, rather than accuracy alone. Simple models get priority when
  data is abundant and patterns are stable, while complex models are preferred when data reveals rich dynamics that simpler
  models miss.
motivation: >-
  Forecasting research has dominated on two incomplete objectives: (1) maximize prediction accuracy, leading to complex overfit
  models that fail under distribution shift, or (2) minimize complexity alone, producing oversimplified predictions that ignore
  genuine structure. Neither approach optimizes the fundamental trade-off between what a model can capture and how much evidence
  we have to warrant capturing it. By making complexity an ONLINE variable that shifts with data abundance and volatility,
  we create a principled adaptive mechanism that would optimize long-run prediction ROI. This could fundamentally change how
  we approach short-horizon forecasting where computational constraints and overfitting risks are highest.
assumptions:
- >-
  Time series exhibits gradually decaying complexity (over time, patterns stabilize from noise to signal, then from simple
  to complex structure)
- >-
  Simple and complex models have complementary strengths (simple models generalize, complex models exploit fine-grained patterns)
- >-
  Data quality does not fundamentally degrade over training horizon (no systematic bias accumulation)
- >-
  Algorithmic complexity can be reliably estimated or approximated for forecasting models
investigation_approach: >-
  Build a multi-model ensemble containing both simple models (last-value, 3-point moving average, linear regression) and complex
  models (LSTM, ARIMA). Implement an online complexity-weighted mechanism where each model receives: (1) a performance score
  (negative error on recent windows), and (2) a complexity penalty (inverse of estimated model complexity). Models' dynamic
  weights are the product of their recent performance and their current complexity penalty signal. Test on diverse synthetic
  time series (random noise, sinusoidal with drift, chaotic Lorenz, non-stationary AR processes) and compare against (a) equal-weighted
  ensemble, (b) performance-only weighting (Bayesian model averaging), (c) naive Last-Value forecast, and (d) 3-point moving
  average.
success_criteria: >-
  The complexity-weighted ensemble will significantly outperform the simple baselines (p<0.01 for MSE and RMSE metrics) across
  at least 70% of test environments. Crucially, it will show superior performance on series with moderate complexity where
  neither oversimplification nor overfitting are obvious choices: non-stationary AR(2) processes with slowly varying coefficients,
  and Lorenz-like chaotic systems with noise. Additionally, complexity-weighted weights should exhibit clear dynamics tracking
  data characteristics (diverging weights when series transitions from noisy to structure-rich phases).
related_works:
- >-
  Abélès et al. (2024, arXiv:2402.14684): Uses online learning expert aggregation to track Markovian variance switches in
  time series. DIFFERENCE: Focuses on detecting regime changes, not managing accuracy-complexity trade-off.
- >-
  Gunasekaran et al. (2025, Nature Communications): Applies predictive coding with future-guided reconstruction. DIFFERENCE:
  Uses two-teacher-student architecture, not complexity-weighted ensemble.
- >-
  Raftery (1995): Bayes model averaging weights models by posterior predictive accuracy. DIFFERENCE: Static Bayesian weights
  based on held-out likelihood, not dynamic complexity-adjusted weighting.
- >-
  Small (2002, Physical Review E): Uses Minimum Description Length (MDL) to select neural network architectures for time series.
  DIFFERENCE: Static architecture selection on static data, not online complexity-aware weighting of diverse models in tournaments.
- >-
  Wood et al. (2023, JMLR): Studies diversity in ensemble learning. DIFFERENCE: Optimizes for prediction agreement variance,
  not complexity-relative accuracy.
inspiration: >-
  Cross-field transfer from OPTIMIZATION THEORY (online learning with expert advice) and STATISTICAL LEARNING THEORY (PAC
  bounds, Occam's Razor principles). Core mechanism: Bayesian portfolio optimization where each "expert" (forecasting model)
  gets both a performance PREDICTION BETTER and a INVERSE COMPLEXITY PREDICTION COST, with all updates happening ONLINE without
  storing full training history.
terms:
- term: Algorithmic complexity
  definition: >-
    The length of the shortest computer program (in a fixed language) that can generate the model's predictions or the underlying
    pattern being modeled. Lower complexity indicates simpler, more parsimonious models.
- term: Online weighting
  definition: >-
    Dynamic adjustment of model weights after each new data point without retraining models, using only a sliding window of
    recent errors and updates.
- term: Prediction ROI
  definition: >-
    The ratio of prediction accuracy improvement to computational/cognitive cost - a measure of how much precision we gain
    per unit of complexity incurred.
- term: Complexity penalty signal
  definition: >-
    A dynamically updating weight inversely proportional to model complexity, designed to favor simpler models when data is
    abundant or noisy, without completely discarding them when they might capture genuine structure.
summary: >-
  Forecasting improves when we dynamically balance model complexity against prediction accuracy rather than optimizing either
  dimension alone. By using online learning principles to maintain complexity-aware weights across Simple vs. Complex models,
  we can adaptively choose which modeling approach fits each regime of the time series.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the hypothesis is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
