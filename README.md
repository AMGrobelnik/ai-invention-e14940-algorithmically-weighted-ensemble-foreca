> **TL;DR** — A complete research paper presenting Algorithmically Weighted Ensemble Forecasting.

<details>
<summary>Full hypothesis</summary>

Time series predictions improve when base forecasting models are dynamically weighted based on their algorithmic complexity (measure of simplicity) relative to recent prediction accuracy, rather than accuracy alone. Simple models get priority when data is abundant and patterns are stable, while complex models are preferred when data reveals rich dynamics that simpler models miss, formalized via complexity penalties linked to parameter counts and structural degrees of freedom.

This repository contains all **3 artifacts** produced across **1 round** of an autonomous AI research run — round by round, exactly in the order they were invented.

## Repository Structure

Artifacts are grouped by the round of invention that produced them. Each
artifact has its own folder with source code and a self-contained demo:

```
.

│   ├── experiment-1/
│   │   ├── README.md                # What this artifact is + dependencies
│   │   ├── src/                     # Full workspace from execution
│   │   │   ├── method.py            # Main implementation

## Running Notebooks

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)

Click the "Open in Colab" badges above to run notebooks directly in your browser.
No installation required!

### Option 2: Local Jupyter

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AMGrobelnik/ai-invention-e14940-algorithmically-weighted-ensemble-foreca
cd ai-invention-e14940-algorithmically-weighted-ensemble-foreca

# Install dependencies
pip install jupyter

# Run any artifact's demo notebook
jupyter notebook <artifact_folder>/demo/
```

## Source Code

The original source files are in each artifact's `src/` folder.
These files may have external dependencies - use the demo notebooks for a self-contained experience.
